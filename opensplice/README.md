## Overview
OpenSplice a full implementaiton of the **OMG DDS Standard** licensed under **Apache 2**. The DDS standard is used today across a large range of application domains ranging from autonomous vehicles, medical devices, robotic platforms, software defined networking, network switches, IoT Gateways, military and aerospace systems, Air Traffic Control and Management, smart grids, smart farms, etc.

## Open Source Add-ons 
There are plenty of Open Source add-ons for OpenSplice and they keep growing almost daily. The main place to look for add one and extensions are [ADLINK-IST's GitHub](https://github.com/ADLINK-IST) repositories. Beside this, below are a few notable extensions:

- **[DDS Tutorial Examples](http://bit.ly/1oAvXhz)**
- **[C++11 Extensions](http://bit.ly/dds-cpp11)**: Support for lambda-based Data Reader listenerns 
- **[Moliere](http://bit.ly/moliere-dds)**: [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) APIs for OpenSplice 
- **[pydds](https://github.com/atolab/pydds)**: Python APIs for OpenSplice
